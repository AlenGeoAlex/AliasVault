# Dictionaries
# During build these are copied from the ../dictionaries folder because firefox zip requires all files to be in the root of the zip.
# Therefore this copied folder is not committed to the repo the original folder is already available outside this directory.
# See vite-plugins/identity-gen-dict-loader.ts for more details.
