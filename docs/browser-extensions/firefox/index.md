# Firefox Extension
In order to install the Firefox Extension, see the options below.

## Download from Firefox Add-ons
Installing the extension from the Firefox Add-ons is the easiest way to get started. This ensures that you are always using the latest version of the extension.

1. Go to the [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/aliasvault/) page
2. Click on the "Add to Firefox" button
3. The extension will be installed and added to your browser

## Build from Source
If you wish to install the extension from source instead, see the [build-from-source](build-from-source.md) documentation. This will allow you to make changes to the extension and/or to use a specific version of the extension.
