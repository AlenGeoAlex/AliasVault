3. The app will be installed. Open the app and follow the instructions.

## Build from Source
If you wish to install the mobile app from source instead, see the [build-from-source](build-from-source.md) documentation. This will allow you to make changes to the mobile app and/or to use a specific version of the mobile app. Note: compiling the iOS app requires a MacOS device.
