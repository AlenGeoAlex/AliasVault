AliasVault is an open-source password and alias manager built with C# ASP.NET technology. AliasVault can be self-hosted on your own server with Docker, providing a secure and private solution for managing your online identities and passwords.

### What makes AliasVault unique:
- **Zero-knowledge architecture**: All data is end-to-end encrypted on the client and stored in encrypted state on the server. Your master password never leaves your device and the server never has access to your data.
- **Built-in email server**: AliasVault includes its own email server that allows you to generate virtual email addresses for each alias. Emails sent to these addresses are instantly visible in the AliasVault app.
- **Alias generation**: Generate aliases and assign them to a website, allowing you to use different email addresses and usernames for each website. Keeping your online identities separate and secure, making it harder for bad actors to link your accounts.
- **Open-source**: The source code is available on GitHub and can be self-hosted on your own server.

> Note: AliasVault is currently in active development and some features may not yet have been (fully) implemented. If you run into any issues, please create an issue on GitHub.

## Live demo
A live demo of the app is available at the official website at [app.aliasvault.net](https://app.aliasvault.net) (up-to-date with `main` branch). You can create a free account to try it out yourself.

## Installation

Choose one of the following installation methods:

### Option 1: Quick Install (using pre-built images)

To install AliasVault on your local machine, follow the steps below. Note: the install process is tested on MacOS and Linux. It should work on Windows too, but you might need to adjust some commands.

### Requirements:
- Access to a terminal
- Docker
- Git

### 1. Quick Install (using pre-built images)
AliasVault comes with a install script that prepares the .env file, builds the Docker image, and starts the AliasVault containers.

```bash
# Download install script
curl -o install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lanedirt/AliasVault/main/install.sh

# Make install script executable and run it
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

### 2. Build from Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lanedirt/AliasVault.git
cd AliasVault

# Make build script executable and run it
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

Note: if you do not wish to run the script, you can set up the environment variables and build the Docker image and containers manually instead. See the [manual setup instructions](docs/install/1-manually-setup-docker.md) for more information.

### 2. Ready to use
The install script executed in step #1 will output the URL where the app is available. By default this is https://localhost for the client and https://localhost/admin for the admin portal.

> Note: If you want to change the default AliasVault ports you can do so in the `docker-compose.yml` file for the `nginx` (reverse-proxy) container.

#### Note for first time build:
- When running the init script for the first time, it may take a few minutes for Docker to download all dependencies. Subsequent builds will be faster.
- A SQLite database file will be created in `./database/AliasServerDb.sqlite`. This file will store all (encrypted) password vaults. It should be kept secure and not shared.

#### Other useful commands:
- To reset the admin password, run the install.sh script with the `--reset-admin-password` flag.
- To uninstall AliasVault, make the uninstall script executable with `chmod +x uninstall.sh` first, then run the script: `./uninstall.sh`.
This will remove all containers, images, and volumes related to AliasVault. It will keep all files and configuration intact however, so you can easily reinstall AliasVault later.

## Security & Architecture
AliasVault takes security seriously and implements various measures to protect your data:

- All sensitive user data is encrypted end-to-end using industry-standard encryption algorithms. This includes the complete vault contents and all received emails.
- Your master password never leaves your device.
- Zero-knowledge architecture ensures the server never has access to your unencrypted data

For detailed information about our encryption implementation and security architecture, see the following documents:
