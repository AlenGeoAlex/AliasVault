AliasVault is an open-source password and identity manager built with C# ASP.NET technology. AliasVault can be self-hosted on your own server with Docker, providing a secure and private solution for managing your online identities and passwords.

### What makes AliasVault unique:
- **Zero-knowledge architecture**: All data is end-to-end encrypted on the client and stored in encrypted state on the server. Your master password never leaves your device and the server never has access to your data.
- **Built-in email server**: AliasVault includes its own email server that allows you to generate virtual email addresses for each identity. Emails sent to these addresses are instantly visible in the AliasVault app.
- **Virtual identities**: Generate virtual identities and assign them to a website, allowing you to use different email addresses and usernames for each website. Keeping your online identities separate and secure, making it harder for attackers to link your accounts.
- **Open-source**: The source code is available on GitHub and can be self-hosted on your own server.

> Note: AliasVault is currently in active development and some features may not yet have been (fully) implemented. If you run into any issues, please create an issue on GitHub.

## Live demo
A live demo of the app is available at [main.aliasvault.net](https://main.aliasvault.net) (nightly builds). You can create a free account to try it out yourself.

## Installation
To install AliasVault on your local machine, follow the steps below. Note: the install process is tested on MacOS and Linux. It should work on Windows too, but you might need to adjust some commands.

### Requirements:
- Access to a terminal
- Docker
- Git

### 1. Clone and run install script
AliasVault comes with a install script that prepares the .env file, builds the Docker image, and starts the AliasVault containers.

```bash
# Clone this Git repository to "AliasVault" directory
$ git clone https://github.com/lanedirt/AliasVault.git

# Go to the project directory
$ cd AliasVault

# Make install script executable and run it.
$ chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

Note: if you do not wish to run the script, you can set up the environment variables and build the Docker image and containers manually instead. See the [manual setup instructions](docs/setup/1-manually-setup-docker.md) for more information.

### 2. Ready to use
The install script executed in step #1 will output the URL where the app is available. By default this is http://localhost:80 for the client and http://localhost:8080 for the admin.

> Note: If you want to change the default AliasVault ports you can do so in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

#### Note for first time build:
- When running the init script for the first time, it may take a few minutes for Docker to download all dependencies. Subsequent builds will be faster.
- A SQLite database file will be created in `./database/AliasServerDb.sqlite`. This file will store all (encrypted) password vaults. It should be kept secure and not shared.

#### Other useful commands:
- To reset the admin password, run the install.sh script with the `--reset-admin-password` flag.
- To uninstall AliasVault, make the uninstall script executable with `chmod +x uninstall.sh` first, then run the script: `./uninstall.sh`.
This will remove all containers, images, and volumes related to AliasVault. It will keep all files and configuration intact however, so you can easily reinstall AliasVault later.
