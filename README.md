> AliasVault is an end-to-end encrypted password and (email) alias manager that protects your privacy by creating alternative identities, passwords and email addresses for every website you use. Use the official supported cloud version or self-host AliasVault on your own server with Docker.

### What makes AliasVault unique:
- **Zero-knowledge architecture**:
    - All data is end-to-end encrypted on the client and stored in encrypted state on the server. Your master password never leaves your device and the server never has access to your data.
- **Built-in email server**:
    - AliasVault includes its own email server that allows you to generate real working email addresses for each alias. Emails sent to these addresses are instantly visible in the AliasVault app and browser extension.
- **Alias generation**:
     - Generate aliases and assign them to a website, allowing you to use different email addresses and usernames for each website. Keeping your online identities separate and secure, making it harder for bad actors to link your accounts.
- **Open-source & Self-hostable**:
    - The source code is available on GitHub and AliasVault can be self-hosted on your own server via an easy install script.

## Self-hosting
For full control over your own data you can self-host and install AliasVault on your own servers. The easiest method is to use the provided install script. This will download the pre-built Docker images and start the containers.

### Install using install script

This method uses pre-built Docker images and works on minimal hardware specifications:

- Linux VM with root access (Ubuntu/AlmaLinux recommended) or Raspberry Pi
- 1 vCPU
- 1GB RAM
- 16GB disk space
- Docker installed

```bash
# Download install script from latest stable release
curl -L -o install.sh https://github.com/lanedirt/AliasVault/releases/latest/download/install.sh

# Make install script executable and run it. This will create the .env file, pull the Docker images, and start the AliasVault containers.
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh install
```

The install script will output the URL where the app is available. By default this is:
- Client: https://localhost
- Admin portal: https://localhost/admin

> Note: If you want to change the default AliasVault ports you can do so in the `.env` file.
